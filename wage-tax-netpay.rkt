;; Demonstrates the use of auxiliary functions in the designing of
;; a program to calculate a sample of a real life problem

;; wage: number->number
;; Function that determines the wage of an employee
;; in relation to his work hours
;; Example: (= (wage 10) 120)
(define (wage h) (* h 12))

; Tests
(check-expect (wage 10) 120)
(check-expect (wage 20) 240)
(check-expect (wage 30) 360)

;; tax: number->number
;; Function that determines the tax an employee
;; must pay in relation to his work hours
;; Example: (= (tax 10) 120)
(define (tax h) (* (wage h) 0.15))

; Tests
(check-expect (tax 10) 18)
(check-expect (tax 20) 36)
(check-expect (tax 30) 54)

;; netpay: number->number
;; Function that determines the net pay of an employee
;; in relation to his work hours
;; Example: (= (netpay 10) 120)
(define (netpay h) (- (wage h) (tax h)))

;; Tests
(check-expect (netpay 10) 102)
(check-expect (netpay 20) 204)
(check-expect (netpay 30) 306)

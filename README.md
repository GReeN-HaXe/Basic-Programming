# Basic.Programming

My name is Rúben, i’m learning Computer Science in the University.
I made this repository to store my solutions on some simple exercises
done while learning basic programming concepts.

I started with functional programming on Racket with the Scheme language
and worked through University exercises and the book: “HOW TO DESIGN
PROGRAMS - An Introduction to Programming and Computing” by M.Felleisen,
R.B.Findler, M.Flatt, S.Krishnamurthi. The book is considered by many as
a good starting point on programming and designing programs, with a
step-by-step approach and a growth in complexity which accompanies the
students growth.

Critics, comments or general help are very much appreciated as this is a
new path for me and i would love to develop the right way. Maybe someday
i can help you.

Thanks for taking the time reading this.

;; Exercise 6.7 in the book:
;; " HOW TO DESIGN PROGRAMS - An Introduction to Programming and Computing "

;; This exercises is part 2 of the introduction of structures in the book
;; It gives insight on structures, the constructors and the selectors it
;; creates.
;; It also allows a first touch with iterative refinement of programs.

;; Problem 6.7.1: Develop the function draw-next-part, which draws pieces of a
;; hangman figure. The function consumes one of the seven symbols: 'right-leg
;; 'left-leg 'left-arm 'right-arm 'body 'head 'noose. It always returns true
;; and draws the matching parts of the figure.

;; draw-next-part: symbol -> boolean
;; Takes a symbol and draws the hangman body part described by the symbol in a
;; canvas.
;; Example: (= (draw-next-part 'head) true)

;; Problem 6.7.2: Provide a structure definition and a data definition for
;; representing three-letter words.

(define-struct word (a b c))
;; a word is a structure:
;                    (make-word a b c)
;; where a, b and c are symbols representing letters.

;; Problem 6.7.3: Develop a function reveal. It consumes three arguments:
;; 1. the chosen word, which is the word that we have to guess;
;; 2. the status word, which shows which portion of the word has been revealed
;; so far;and
;; 3. a letter, which is our current guess.
;; The function produces a new status word, that is, a word that contains
;; ordinary letters and '_. The fields in the new status word are determined
;; by comparing the guess with each pair of letter from the status word and
;; the chosen word.

;; reveal: word word symbol -> word
;; The function takes a secret word composed of three letter which are to be
;; guessed, a status word which determines the status of the guessed letters
;; and a symbol which is the guess
;; Example: (= (reveal (make-word 't 'e 'a) (make-word '_ 'e '_) 't)

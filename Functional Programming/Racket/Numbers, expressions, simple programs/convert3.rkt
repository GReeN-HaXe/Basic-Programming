;; Demonstrates the understanding of the text of a problem
;; and the conversion from text to a mathematical function.
;; Tests are also used to test diferent or special values.

;; convert3: number number number -> number
;; Takes three digits and returns a number 
;; with the order of the digits reversed.
;; Example: (= (convert3 1 2 3) 321)
(define (convert3 a b c)
  (+ (* c 100) (* b 10) a))

;; Tests
(check-expect (convert3 1 2 3) 321)
(check-expect (convert3 4 5 6) 654)
(check-expect (convert3 7 2 7) 727)

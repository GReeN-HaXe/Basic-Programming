;; Exercise 6.2.1/2/3/4/5 in the book "HOW TO DESIGN PROGRAMS - An
;; Introduction to Programming and Computing" by M.Felleisen, R.B.Findler,
;; M.Flatt, S.Krishnamurthi.

;; This exercise illustrates the use of data structures as inputs and
;; outputs, value extraction from records and use of global definitions
;; for defining constants

;; Problem 6.2.1: Evaluate the following functions in order:
(start 300 300) ;; opens the canvas for future drawing

(draw-solid-line (make-posn 1 1) (make-posn 5 5) 'red)
;; draws a line with starting/ending points and the color red

(draw-solid-rect (make-posn 20 10) 50 200 'blue)
;; draws a rectangle with upper left point width/height and color blue

(draw-circle (make-posn 200 10) 50 'red)
;; draws a circle with center point, radius and the color red

(draw-solid-disk (make-posn 200 10) 50 'green)
;; draws a disk with center point, radius and the color red

(stop) ;; closes the canvas
